Steps
1. View the manual entry for the ls command. Notice in the SYNOPSIS, the format of the command is as follows:

   ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   Anything in square brackets is optional. In this case, we can use ls along with one of the options listed with - or -- and we could add a complete file path.
2. Scroll through to manual to find the option that will provide a long listing format for the ls command.
3. Exit the manual (Note that you need to type q to get out of the manual!) and try this command with the option you found. Donâ€™t forget to include the - or --!
4. Answer question 4 in EDURange
